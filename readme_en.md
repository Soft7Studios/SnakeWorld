**This is just the beginning.**
Improvements such as the implementation of sounds and more game modes may be added in the near future.

I haven't been able to implement many things yet because I don't yet have the necessary knowledge and skills.
But I have the motivation and desire to learn.
I hope to bring future updates that include sounds, new game modes, and more visual and gameplay improvements.

**Snake World**
It's a project with potential, and I want it to have more depth and unique modes over time.
I don't promise updates will come quickly... but I'll try to make them **arrive**.
